Código is a firmware distribution service with an IoT twist. Developed conceptually as research project at the University of Edinburgh. We're bringing the idea into the twenty-twenties by rebuilding the network framework as a Dapp. Built to act as a shop-window for users to manage their IoT devices, the platform works to incentivise developers to build, maintain and contribute firmware to be securely deployment across a host of devices in the IoT domain as a system with no single point of failure, helping to solve one of the biggest challenges facing the uptake of this domain - security.

We're building a Dapp using React, tied in with 3box (for user management and data storage), deployed on Fleek and integrated with both Ethereum (for user incentivisation) and Filecoin (to manage distributed firmware storage).
